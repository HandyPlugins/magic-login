== Installation ==

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the entire `/magic-login` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate Magic Login through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is passwordless authentication? =

Passwordless authentication is an authentication method in which a user can log in to a computer system without entering (and remembering) a password.

= Are the magic links secure? =

Yes! In fact, we thought this is more secure than the regular login due to most of the users are using weak passwords. Since magic login generates a random token for a limited time frame it makes the links quite strong and secure.

= When do login links expire? =

It expires in 5 minutes by default. You can change TTL under the "Token Lifespan" on the settings page. Enter "0" to disable automatic expiration.

= Why am I not getting login links? =

Magic Login uses WordPress built-in mail functions. So, it depends on your configuration. We highly recommend to use an SMTP service for better email delivery.

= How can I use a passwordless login form on any page? =

You can use `[magic_login_form]` shortcode or block. [Learn More.](https://handyplugins.co/docs/add-magic-login-form-to-a-page/)

= Why are users redirected back to the page where they added the magic login form via shortcode? =

This behavior occurs because the magic login form is designed to use the current page as the target redirection URL by default. It's a way to ensure a smooth user experience by bringing users back to the page they started from.
However, if you wish to alter this behavior, you can easily do so by passing an empty redirect_to="" parameter within the shortcode.  [Learn More.](https://handyplugins.co/docs/magic-login-shortcode/)
