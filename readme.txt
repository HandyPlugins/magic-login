== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is passwordless authentication? =

Passwordless authentication is an authentication method in which a user can log in to a computer system without the entering (and remembering) a password.

= Is the magic links are secure? =

Yes! In fact, we thought this is more secure than the regular login due to most of the users are using weak passwords. Since magic login generates a random token for a limited time frame it makes the links quite strong and secure. Also, tokens can be used only once.

= When does login links expire? =

It expires in 5 minutes by default. You can change TTL under the "Token Lifespan" on the settings page. Enter "0" to disable automatic expiration.

= Why am I not getting login links? =

Magic Login uses WordPress built-in mail functions. So, it depends on your configuration. We highly recommend to use a SMTP services for better email delivery.

= How can I use a passwordless login form on any page? =

You can use `[magic_login_form]` shortcode or block. [Learn More.](https://handyplugins.co/magic-login-pro/docs/add-login-form-to-a-page/)
